## i2b2 Web Client Plugin  - Healthcare System Dynamics Plugins
Developed as part of "Visualizing healthcare system dynamics in biomedical big data", an NIH-funded project in the Weber Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. Biomedical Big Data, such as electronic health records (EHR) and administrative claims, are records of patients' interactions with the healthcare system; for example, the date of a diagnosis is when a physician entered the code into the EHR, not when the patient developed the disease. Most researchers are either unaware of the distinction or naively treat it as noise. However, the proposed research will show, using a novel Data Visualization, that these subtle effects of the healthcare system on observational clinical data actually contain valuable information that could benefit biomedical research, clinical care, and health care policy.
